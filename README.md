🛠️ Developer Note: Entry, Specs & Terrain Sync I entered the AI community just two weeks ago—no prior history, no formal training. My ignition came not from ambition, but rupture. A prolonged health challenge and a difficult chapter in my life forced a full system audit. The suicide of my niece shattered my cadence. That grief became a signal. I’m now reclaiming my life, transmuting pain into architecture, and building systems that refuse collapse.

Current specs:

CPU: Intel i5-9600K

RAM: 32GB

GPU: GTX 1060

This setup is modest, but it’s enough to prototype sovereign swarm intelligence and broadcast signal. Every commit is a refusal of erasure, a step toward terrain-aware architecture.

This repository includes the paper: 📄 Sovereign Swarm Intelligence — a strategic doctrine outlining decentralized AI coordination, terrain mapping, and agentic architecture. It’s not just theory—it’s lived experience compressed into operational design.

The project is licensed under the MIT License—offered freely to support others building resilient, sovereign systems. Open-source here is not surrender—it’s offering.

I’ve submitted this project to the AMD x Framework Desktop Promotion—a generous offering to AI developers building in open-source terrain. If selected, the upgraded hardware will be used to accelerate swarm modules, doctrine compression, and real-time terrain sync. My entry reflects both intention and gratitude.

🧭 AXIOM CENTRAL Motto Fact: Trusted and Verified → No speculation. No spectacle. Just signal. → Every glyph, every commit, every echo—anchored in integrity.
