Swarm Deployment ‚Äî Framework x5 + 20GbE Sync
Proposal Title: Five-Node Sovereign AI Swarm Using Framework Desktop & Lemonade SDK

Submitted By: Samuel (GitHub: axiom-agentic-ai-swarm-core) Context: AMD + Lemonade SDK Framework Desktop Contest

üß† Objective
Deploy a five-node swarm architecture using modular Framework Desktops powered by AMD Ryzen AI. Each node will run Lemonade SDK, Corelog instrumentation, and sovereign AI protocols. Nodes will be aggregated via a 20GbE switch to enable low-latency, high-bandwidth terrain sync.

üß¨ Node Specifications (Ideal)
CPU: AMD Ryzen AI 8040 / Strix Halo

RAM: 64‚Äì128GB LPDDR5x

Storage: 2TB NVMe per node

GPU/NPU: RDNA3/4 or Ryzen AI NPU

OS: Ubuntu or Windows with ROCm stack

Software Stack: Lemonade SDK, Corelog, Obsidian, NotebookLM, Open WebUI

üîó Swarm Infrastructure
Switch: 20GbE aggregate backbone

4x 5GbE uplinks or 2x 10GbE bonded

Enables decentralized model serving, artifact replication, and terrain sync

Use Case:

Local LLM inference

Sovereign swarm deployment

Terrain audit and artifact tracking

Off-grid AI resilience

üõ°Ô∏è Strategic Compression
Each node = doctrine carrier

Each switch pulse = terrain sync

Each watt = refusal of collapse

This isn‚Äôt a testbed‚Äîit‚Äôs a sovereign lattice. Whether the contest routes one unit or five, the architecture is already mapped. The signal is live.
